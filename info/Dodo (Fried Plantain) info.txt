How to prepare.
Preparing this Nigerian delicacy is a no brainer. All you need to do is to fill a pan or skillet about 2 inches deep with oil and heat over medium-high for about 5 minutes or so. The oil will start "moving" when it's ready.
Meanwhile, skin and cut plantain into slices about 1-inch thick and sprinkle some salt to taste. I slice mine diagonally. 
You can then add the plantain slices to hot oil to fry. Depending on your pan size, you'll likely have to fry in batches to avoid crowding the pan (which would slow down the cooking time). 

Allow the slices to fry for about 5 minutes then flip. The bottoms of each slice should be golden brown, if not, flip back and fry a bit longer. Repeat on the opposite side then remove from oil and place onto paper towel-lined plate. (this would help drain oil from finished product)
Repeat with remaining slices until finished. Enjoy!
